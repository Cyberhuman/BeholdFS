This is still work in progress. Do not expect much.

Known problems:
- dirs_tags are not preserved for directories upon rename (renamed directory won't be filtered out by exclusive tags)
- readdir() is terribly slow
- tags are not shown in the directory structure (for less frequently used tags, in '%' subdirectory)
